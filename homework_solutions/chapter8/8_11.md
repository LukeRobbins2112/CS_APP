// How many “hello” output lines does this program print?


#include "csapp.h"

 int main(){
 int i;

 for (i = 0; i < 2; i++)
     Fork();
 printf("hello\n");
 exit(0);
}


SOLUTION
------------------------------
- Prints 4 lines
- Starts with parent process 0
- First loop creates child process
- Second loop runs for both parent and child processes, which each fork a child
- At this point, there are 4 processes, which all fail the loop check and exit the loop
- Each process prints "hello" and exits
