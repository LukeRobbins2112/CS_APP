In this chapter, we have introduced some functions with unusual call and return
behaviors: setjmp, longjmp, execve, and fork. Match each function with one of
the following behaviors:

A. Called once, returns twice.
B. Called once, never returns.
C. Called once, returns one or more times

SOLUTION
----------------------------

A. fork()
B. execve() - assuming it succeeds
C. setjmp
